### *_Project Description_*

<p align = "justify">

The box office analytics project, Cinemalytics, unveils a meticulously developed box office web application alongside the backend prowess of Django, with an unwavering focus on Big Data approaches and SQLite3 as the database foundation. 

<br/>

Dive into the core of this project, wherein the primary goal transcends conventional boundaries, which aims to construct a comprehensive box office analytics project that goes further with the integration of Big Data processing techniques to build a scalable box office prediction model and implement visualization charts for thorough data insights.

### *_Project Specifications_*

<p align = "justify">

<b>1. Data and Database</b>
> The box office analytics project, Cinemalytics, sources the box office information from The TMDb (The Movie Database), a comprehensive film database that provides information concerning films, which includes details such as titles, ratings, release dates, revenue, genres, and so on, to be employed for Big Data processing techniques.

<br/>

> The sourced database contains more than 963,000 various films which were released as far as from the year 1899 to 2023. By means of this, those details such as genres, adult, vote count, popularity, and vote average offer a nuanced understanding of audience preferences, film reception, and marketing appeal; poster path helps to visualize the nature and impression within the film; while the budget contributes as the core for the box office status based on 2.5x break‚Äìeven multiplier and revenue prediction.

<br/>

<b>2. Big Data-Driven Box Office Prediction</b>
> Within the box office analytics project, Cinemalytics, a multiple linear regression model, was integrated into the developed web application that draws upon an extensive array of box office features with an R‚Äìsquared value of at least 0.60. Accordingly, the web application embraces user-centric design to let box office enthusiasts and industry professionals contribute to such predictive prowess.

<br/>

> Users can seamlessly input data across various attributes ‚Äì budget, vote count, vote average, popularity, and genres ‚Äì which fosters an interactive and intuitive experience that transcends the conventional boundaries of revenue prediction in the cinematic realm.

<br/>

<b>3. Data Visualization</b>
> The analytics journey of this box office analytics project, Cinemalytics, extends beyond mere prediction; as such employs a diverse arsenal of visualization techniques. From the nuanced depiction of value versus residual distributions through a bell curve and histogram to the dynamic portrayal of value trends via line graph and scatter plot, the platform transforms raw data into visual narratives.

<br/>

> Accordingly, the insights are further enriched by the integration of a radar chart and correlation matrix, which offers a holistic perspective on the intricate relationships within box office features.

### *_Acknowledgements_*

<p align = "justify">

First and foremost, box office analytics project, Cinemalytics, would not have been made possible without the efforts and hard work produced by fellow contributors and developers in the group. Lest without these following individuals, the entire project would never have succeeded.

<br/>

Finally, the group would like to take this opportunity to express the deepest gratitude to the subject adviser, Sir Lumer Jude Doce, for his exemplary guidance and feedback throughout the project development. His perspective criticism inspired the group to continue working.
